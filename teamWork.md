#How often you met, and why you met that often
We, as a team decided to meet every 3 days for the first 2 weeks of the iteration and in the last week we managed to meet 5 days of the week. Initially there was less work and every one of us had other commitments for the initial two weeks so we meet every 3 days and made sure that every one of us was on track to finish the work we had planned to finish before every meeting. For the last week we decided to meet almost every day because there we some small errors that we faced which needed us to understand other team memberâ€™s functionality of the function. We also did discord meetings and code sharing on regular basis to make sure that we are completely aware of other team members work and progress. We had also mad a Facebook chat to discuss any remaining problems.

#What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful
We decided that to make the most out of the team meetings each member will first speak the difficulties he was facing and others will try and help him out and after there the other members will do the same thing. This helped us in a way that we were most effective as a team in solving any difficulties we faced in our way.

#What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3
When things did not go as we planned to go them, during that period we decided to give ourselves a small break and sit back and observe our mistakes and then we discussed the problems we had and the mistakes we had made so next time those mistakes were taken care of and we also helped each other out by listening to other team members problems and discussing the possible solutions.
