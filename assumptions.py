I assume that when a person leaves a channel they are not a member anymore so if the channel is private they have to be added back and inviting someone makes them a memeber 

auth_addowner / remove owner assume only someone that is currently an owner has this power

Assume the owner/admin to the slack is the developer and the channel owner is just people that run the channel 

If someone is made an admin, assume that they can join in channels that are private when they have not been invited to them
