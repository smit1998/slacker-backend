1. So in the function channel_create(), can we let one user to create more than one channel ? 

2. So in the function message_sendlater(), the date should be like the time when another channel 
should be received messages, or should be the time channel send the message to another channel

3. When it comes to private or public, so if the name of channel would be private, is it 
meaning that the name would only be private to the people who are not in this channel, or
it is also private to the people who are in the channel
