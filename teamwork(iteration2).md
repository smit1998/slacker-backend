#How often you met, and why you met that often?
-> Our team had meetings on every thursday after he lab.
-> We had short Discord meetings every 3 days to keep track of where everyone is and how much is done and to clear each others doubts.
-> We also had a facebook messenger group chat created for the discussion of problems and doubts.

#What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful?
-> We had a plan for every meeting decided before the meeting and in every meeting each member first speaks there doubts and than after than we discussed them. this plan made sure that everyone's doubts and ideas are discussed in the team and we tackeled them as a team. We also enssured that our code was good enough by showing it to atleast one of the team members. This methods ensured that the meetings were successful.

#What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration to?
-> One of the major problem faced by our team was time management which we later decided that we will decide a timeline for ourselves and post it to the facebook group and than made sure that timeline is followed by the individual member.
-> For the  problems that occured in the way, as a team we decided to handle it with maturity and discussed each and every small or big problems we had and found some solution of the problems.

#Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code?
-> We had divided the functions equally among ourselves and than in every Discord meetings(similar to standup's) and every physical meeting we explained our code to other team members so that other member are aware of what methods and practices were used by each and every team member. This amde sure that multiple people working on the same problem don't have toruble understanding how other member's code works.

-> Thus my following the above agile practices of planning and splitting the work into small chunks and evaluating each others works continuously we, as a team have tackeled all the problems.
