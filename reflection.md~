OUTCOMES OF TEAM MEETINGS:-
    Assisted each other in understanding the project specifications
    Wrote user stories.
    Planned our approach to the assignment.
    Distributed components of the assignment evenly among team members.
DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES:-
    Divided the total 32 functions into groups of 8 functions which were taken by each member.
DISAGREEMENTS:-
    Initially, organising a suitable time based on each team member availability was quite difficult so we decided on online calls via Discord.

Distributing the workload for iteration 1 was very successful as we evenly allocated the 32 functions to 8 functions per person.For iteration 01 we want to be an agile team, so at the beginning of the project, we made sure everybody understood what they needed to do,  and the sequence of this testing functions also would be taken into account, for example: we need to finish some basic functions as quick as possible, the auth_login and auth_logout, cause we just needed to create basic information of authorized user. After that, there are some functions like channel_details, channel_invite, channel_ messages, etc where there were some information we can get through using the values we created before, so this would be a good sequence to follow in the iteration 01, and we also used Facebook to communicate our questions. Over the course of the development for this iteration we had multiple online calls and discussed over the project specifications and pytest methods. Originally, some of the members had issues with either the written or the coding components of the iteration which meant that significant discussion was required through consistent team meetings. Nevertheless, the team collaborated quite effectively as all the members contributed to both the written tasks and computing tasks.
