A list of things we tried to avoid in our project:-
Design smells:
Rigidity: Tendency to be too difficult to change
Fragility: Tendency for software to break when single change is made
Immobility: Previous work is hard to reuse or move
Viscosity: Changes feel very slow to implement
Opacity: Difficult to understand
Needless complexity:  Things done more complex than they should be
Needless repetition: Lack of unified structures
Coupling: Interdependence between components

A list of the principles used in our code for this project:-

"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY)
"Keep it Simple, Stupid" (KISS)
Encapsulation: Maintaining type abstraction by restricting direct access to internal representation of types (types include classes)
"You aren't going to need it" (YAGNI) that says a programmer should not add functionality until it is needed.

For our generation functions in terms of user, channel and message ID?s, we utilised the DRY concept to merge our incremental functions into one. We did this to minimize the amount of repetition in code so that the same configuration is not written in multiple places. This change also reduced the total code length to improve the transparency of our code and lessen complexity. To further ease the understanding of our code, we made commenting a crucial step in our code development, in which each function and exception should contain some extent of commenting so that not only the other team members would be able to understand easily but other individuals reading the code would also follow through. To keep the code as simple as possible we also decided that if there were any functions that we needed in more than one team member?s code than only one of us would make that function and others will see the code from his branch and try to keep the code as synchronized as possible and this also helped us in following the principle of KISS (keep it simple, stupid). For example, we all needed a function to get that data dictionary we had made so one of our team member made a function called getData() which was then used by all of us in our code which kept our code synchronized, the other example of this is the getUserFromToken() which was needed to all of us in different things and for different uses so we decided to make this which instead of returning the specific field like  ?u_id? or a ?name_first? it would return a dictionary of that user so each of us can use it to our need which helped us in keeping the code simple and also making the code as small as possible. This also helped in reducing the needless complexity of our code and made it less opatic( difficult to understand) 
we also tried to refactor our code in a sense that we removed each and every unnecessary function or the one?s which we were not going to need in future which was made by us in the iteration 2. We also made a collaborative effort in maintaining the sequence of our function as given in the specification which would help someone from outside read our code and specification more easier and would be easier to understand because all the functionalities of the specific characteristics of a function in the same order. One of the key changes made in our code was when the iteration 2 was over and we found that most of our test cases from iteration 1 were not correct and we had to change them. We than decided to write the test cases for individual function and finish that function with the test cases which made sure that all our test cases and the functions were working as required and this method also helped us in making sure that our functions were correct and we confirmed this using the postman which helped us in achieving a lot of clear view on our functions and the errors in our functions. But even after that there we some functions which passed all the test cases and worked properly on the postman but had some small bugs on the frontend when we tried to run them on the frontend this helped us in realising that we had used different names in some functions when we tried to use the functions created by other members so decided to get together and remove all the functions that we were not using or we were using same functions with different name for the same purpose which helped us solving our problems. This way we avoided the repetition of the code which made our structure more unified.

Thus, the following changes were made by our team and we used the above software engineering principles to achieve our desired goals and complete the project assigned to our team in accordance with the software engineering rules and principles keeping the seriousness of the project assigned and completing it as per the rules and specifications.
