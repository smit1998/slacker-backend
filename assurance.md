To verify that our backend functions satisfy the given specifications of the product as well as effectively completing the design descriptions for the system, we checked every function closely with the descriptions of the spec so that all aspects of the required system has been covered. We also utilized a branch coverage method to validate that the system can confidently accomplish its intended uses and objectives.

Thus in this way we covered both the verification and validation steps in the process of building the backend.
=======
->We firstly wrote all the functions by distributing the functions evenly across the team and individually tested it with separate pytests which we had written in iteration 1. We made sure that our code passed all the tests and also made changes to the tests to resolve unexpected issues from iteration 1. We made sure to add some extra tests in the test file to make sure that all the remaining cases which might have been left off in iteration 1 were covered.
->To further validate our system we used the postman application to test that the right functions were built.
Hence, through these methods we covered both the verification and validation steps in the process of building the backend.
